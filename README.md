# Webpack clone

this is a project that follow the instruction from [this article](https://juejin.cn/post/7031546400034947108#heading-16), which explains how webpack works.
even though it is a much simplified version, but the concept is there.

Just run `npm install` to insall the required library.

I have provided a exmaple project to be bundled, but you can change the code inside `Example` folder.

Current version only support  `require` not support ES6 `import` syntax, which can be resolved by modifing the code inside `core/compiler`.
